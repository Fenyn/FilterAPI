# FilterAPI
Small coding project to create a FilterAPI for a job application. An application manages access to “resource” objects (e.g a user) and we need to provide a Java API for querying the set of available resources. One of the requirements for the query API is to have filtering functionality allowing clients to select resources which match certain criteria. For the sake of simplicity, a “resource” is represented using a Map&lt;String,String> which maps “property” names (keys) to their values. Property names are case sensitive, but property values are not.
